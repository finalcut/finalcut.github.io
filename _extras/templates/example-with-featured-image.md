# Your Post Content Here

This is an example of how to structure a post with a featured image that will display properly when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

## Image Recommendations

- **Open Graph (og_image)**: 1200x630px - Used by Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack
- **Teaser**: 500x300px - Used in post listings and archives
- **Header**: 1280x400px - Full-width header image at top of post
- **Simple image**: 1200x630px works well as a multipurpose featured image

## File Organization

Store your images in:
```
assets/
  images/
    posts/
      2025/
        your-post-images.jpg
```

This keeps your post images organized by year and separate from site assets.

Eventually I'll just move rawlinson.us here and not have a subdomain like code.rawlinson.us - and this'll just have whatever topics I'm thinking about. Maybe I'll even build my own theme.  We'll see.

I am a settled-nomad. I've lived in A LOT of places but I have lived, for a long time, in Appalachia.  West Virginia to be more exact.  I love it here and my wife and I have raised two awesome people to adulthood.  They are both off doing cool shit and the two of us are trying to figure out what our future looks like.

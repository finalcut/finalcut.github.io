There has been [a lot of chatter](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?si
d=05/05/16/0052245&tid=95&tid=154&tid=156&tid=1) recently about [GreaseMonkey]
(http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http%3A//greasemonkey.mozdev.org/&ei
=4_yIQo39F6DIiwHSyMzvBQ). If you don't know what greasemonkey is well, its an
extension to Firefox that lets users run their own scripts on webpages and
thus modifying them instantly.



You might be saying, "HUH?" why would I want to do that? Well, let me tell ya!
First off there are hundreds of greasemokey scripts already written - so you
don't have to know a thing about writing scripts. There are other folks out
there doing that for you. Some of these scripts are really useful (some are
not). For instance, one adds a "delete" button to gmail. If you use gmail then
you will know how handy that would be. There is also one that stops new
windows from opening in hotmail. There are tons of them. However, until today
I hadn't really seen one that made me really like greasemonkey.



[Book Burro](http://overstimulate.com/articles/2005/04/24/greasemonkey-book-
burro-find-cheap-books) is a greasemonkey script that digs around all the
different online bookstores and provides you with price comparisons from each.
Look, I can't explain it better than the guy who made it does since he
includes screen shots. So [visit his
site](http://overstimulate.com/articles/2005/04/24/greasemonkey-book-burro-
find-cheap-books) and see what all the fuss is about. If you buy books online
then you MUST GET Book Burro - it simply rocks.

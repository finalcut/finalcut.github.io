So, for some crazy reason my blog was flagged by Blogger as a "spam blog". I
am not sure if that is because people were flagging it maliciously or what but
after about a week of waiting (from the time I asked blogger to review) I
received an email today telling me my blog is, in fact, NOT a spam blog.
Hooray!  
  
You may be wondering how I knew my blog was identified by blogger as a spam
blog. Well, prior to today for about the past six months-year I have had to
fill out a captcha just to post to my own blog. I had thought this captcha was
just a side-effect to me demanding captcha's on all comments people leave on
the blog because it seemed to appear pretty closely to when I turned on that
feature. However, there was a little text link beside the captcha that said
"why am I seeing this" which I have always ignored. Curiosity piqued the other
day though and I clicked it and found out I was considered a spam blog.
Fortunately it was an easy, albeit slow, process for getting my blog's name
cleared.

The exact same thing happened to me on [my blog](agileui.blogspot.com). And
just last week, I noticed that little link. I am pretty sure it wasn't there
'til recently, but I am so glad that I no longer need to deal with that.

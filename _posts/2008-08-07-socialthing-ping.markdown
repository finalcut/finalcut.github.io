[SocialThing ](http://www.socialthing.com) \+ [Ping.fm](http://ping.fm) looks
like a great marriage. Now I can post to all and view from all in one
centralized place. Sweetness.  
  
Basically, after setting up a ping.fm account (and associating all my other
social accounts with it) I then setup a SocialThing account. Social Thing is a
life streaming service. Basically that means they aggregate all the bits and
pieces of data that normally flows on all your different services like twitter
and facebook and displays them in one neat and easy to read place. However,
SocialThing also now has integrated with ping.fm so you can post a note to
ping.fm. Ping.fm then propogates that post out to all those same services.  
  
Before the SocialThing+Ping.fm integration occured you were stuck having to go
to Ping.fm (or some similar service) and post your message then you had to go
to SocialThing (or some similar service) to read all your friends
posts/updates. It was clunky. Now, however, it is a one stop shop of social
goodness. You can post your status update/microblog message and follow
everyone elses activity all from the same place.

I just read about the newest part of the Google Maps API - Elevation. I
immediately stole their demo application and put the [Google Maps Elevation
API](http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2010/03/aint-no-mountain-high-
enough.html) to [practical use](http://sites.google.com/site/huntingtonwvfiber
/why-huntington/our-maps?pli=1) alongside a stop motion animation video I made
using Google Street View. You can see both [over
here](http://sites.google.com/site/huntingtonwvfiber/why-huntington/our-
maps?pli=1).  
  
You have to scroll down on the page but the video is a tour through my
hometown made using Google Street View and Picasa. The map under it shows the
elevation changes as you travel the same route. The best thing I could do (but
don't at the moment) would be to figure out a way to synchronize the two so
that as the movie played the little placemark in the map moved.  
  
For the time being you can hover over the bar chart at the bottom and you'll
see a green placemark move around the map as you move over the chart.

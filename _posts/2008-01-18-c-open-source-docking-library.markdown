I am working on a project that just begs for a dockable window interface and,
fortunately, there is a pretty nice open source solution to that exact problem
called "[Dock Panel Suite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite/)"  
  
It is really easy to get up and running and, in less than 4 hours, we had
converted our entire MDI application into a dockable MDI application (ala
Visual Studio). It's really quite nice. A nice bonus is that it is still
actively maintained.  
  
The only real drawback is a dearth of documentation. However, the sample app
does help get you rolling.

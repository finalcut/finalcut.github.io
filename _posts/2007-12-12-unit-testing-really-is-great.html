Everyonce in a while I work on something that reminds me how great unit testing is.  No, it isn't the end all be all of testing - but boy, it sure does make your life a lot easier if you use it.<br /><br />For example, tonight I was working on an object we will call "COMPONENT" and the component has a collection of objects called "CURVES" and each curve has a collection of "POINTS".  The COMPONENT has two dates associated with it - a basis date and a cut off date.  If the basis date changes any POINT on the CURVEs with a date after the cutoff date have to shift the same amount of time as the basis date just shifted on the change.<br /><br />This kind of thing would be a real bear to test any other way besides unit testing.  With unit testing I was able to quickly craft some tests that shift the basis date forward and backward and check all sorts of random POINT date values - and their value relative to the basis date AND make sure the dates before or on the cutoff date don't shift.  I can't imagine testing this sort of situation so completely without unit testing.</div>

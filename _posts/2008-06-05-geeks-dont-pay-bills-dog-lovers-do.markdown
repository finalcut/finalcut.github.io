I use Google Adsense on this site and a few others I own. One is a site
dedicated to [helping rescue Dachshunds](http://doxie.org). I don't really
make much money on the various sites but I decided today to compare the month
of may and what I saw kind of surprised me.  
Domain| Page Impressions| Earnings  
---|---|---  
doxie.org| 2,157| $21.75  
cf-bill.blogspot.com| 8,494| $4.47  
rawlinson. us| 3,751| $2.60  
  
  
I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to be showing this kind of stuff publicly
but I figured, what the heck. This site is typically visited by developers
and, clearly, we don't click on many ads. The rawlinson.us site is actually
visited mostly by people setting up blogs due to [a
plugin](http://www.rawlinson.us/blog/?p=212) I have there.  
  
The doxie.org site is targeted toward dog lovers. I have to imagine, more than
likely, it is actually visited by people who are looking to buy dachshunds
(which, they can't do via the doxie.org organization). In fact I typically
blacklist places that sell doxie's if I see one of their ads because we are
trying to help dogs that need a new home get there and we are opposed to puppy
mills and backyard breeders. However, if my site, that doesn't come up early
in Google still manages to make this much money per day (about $1) off of the
ads that make it up there I can't imagine how many of these little dogs are
actually sold and thus how much money is actually made in the business of dog
breeding. It's kind of stunning really.

That's fantastic. There are so many dogs out there that are perfectly loving
but just don't have a home.  
  
Thanks for opening your doors to a doxie!

We just put in our application at the Southern States rescue
(http://www.ssdr.org/) here in Nolensville!  
  
We had a couple of Dachshunds growing up so as soon as we got into a house
were we could have a dog that was the first thing we did.

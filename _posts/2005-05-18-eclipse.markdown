A quick reference to finding and downloading the latest and greatest stable
version of Eclipse; CFEclipse, Colorer, and maintaining your plugins across
multiple Eclipse installs (or upgrades).  

First you need to go to the [downloads
page](http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.php). However, once there, they hide
the new milestone release from you. You need to click on the link "looking for
the old [Eclipse downloads
page](http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php)?" True, you could just
click on that link now, but that takes you out of the framed interface of the
eclipse.org site - which may not be a good thing.  

Then just click on the link for the "xxx.x Stream stable build" - typically
this will be the next upgrade level. For instance right now xxx.x = 3.1  

Now that you have Eclipse you should check out [how to install your plug ins
separately from Eclipse](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t18678.html) (so
you can have multiple copies of Eclipse installed using the same plugins), and
of course you should check out
[CFEclipse](http://www.spike.org.uk/blog/index.cfm) (grab the latest nightly
build) so that you can do all your CF development. Finally, you may want to
give [Colorer](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855) a
look (its a syntax highlighting plugin for Eclipse for stuff like javascript,
xml, etc.; however it doesn't work with 3.1 M7 currently).

The other day I was over at del.icio.us and saw a bunch of new bookmarks to
[Aardvark](http://www.karmatics.com/aardvark/), a firefox extension, but I
ignored them. Then today, at fullasagoog, I saw a link to digitalmediaminute
that was also talking about Aardvark so I decided I could at least check it
out.  

It's very very cool; at least from a web developers perspective. It gives you
another nice tool for debugging CSS.  

If you haven't seen it yet, or even heard of it, consider this your invitation
to go check it out. You will probably be glad you did.

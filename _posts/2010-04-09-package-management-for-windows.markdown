All I can say is - it's about time! According to this article by ArsTechnica
Microsoft Developer [Gerrett Serack is embarking on the bold plan to produce
an open source package management solution for Windows](http://arstechnica.com
/open-source/news/2010/04/microsoft-offers-much-needed-fix-for-windows-oss-
development.ars). Meaning windows users will have something akin to APT. Very
very cool. Even better it is a community driven project and not a Microsoft
Driven one so hopefully the end result will be something we all want and will
use.  
  
Like I said, It's about time.

I knew about the new anti-phishing features in Firefox but today was the first
time I bothered to see how they worked. The attached screen shot shows what
happens when Firefox detects a site is fraudulent.  

Now, I'm not advocating trusting your browser to always protect you but it is
nice to see the tools being implemented that can at least help.

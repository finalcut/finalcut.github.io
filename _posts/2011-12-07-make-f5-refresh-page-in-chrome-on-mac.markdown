It turns out the F5 key doesn't do a page refresh on a mac. That is a habit I
just don't think I'll be able to break. Fortunately, macs have a built in way
to define application specific keyboard mappings. Here are the instructions
for mapping the F5 key to refresh in Chrome.  

>   1. Launch "System Preferences"

>   2. Click the "Keyboard" icon

>   3. Select "Keyboard Shortcuts" tab

>   4. Hit the little "+" button under the main white area

>   5. In the little pup-up window select "Google Chrome" as the Application

>   6. Type in "Reload This Page" in the "Menu Title" field exactly as it
appears in the Chrome's View menu (no quotes of course)

>   7. Click inside the "Keyboard Shortcut" field and hit F5 key (or any
desired combination)

>   8. Restart Chrome to make it work

  
  
If you use safari this same process will work for that application as well

I may get used to that but I like just hitting one key.  
  
I have a lot of adjusting going on just getting used to the overall
experience, so making page refresh familiar is a small indulgence for me.  
  
Thanks for the correct shortcut though, I'll see if I can start adopting it.

Command+r does a page reload by default in all browsers I've used on OS X.

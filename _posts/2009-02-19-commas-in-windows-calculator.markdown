So, color me ignorant, but one thing I've always disliked about windows
calculator is when you have a large number, say 3 trillion, there are no
commas to help you group the digits and easily identify the value for what it
is.  
  
Well, you can have it display commas. Go to the "View" menu and select "Digit
Grouping" and BAM! you have commas.  
  
Simple and easy. I don't know for how many years that has existed but I just
found out about it today. I don't think I've ever looked at any of the menu's
on the calculator so now I'll have to explore a bit more.

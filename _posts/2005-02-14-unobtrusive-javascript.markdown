As a huge proponent of unobtrusive javascript I figure I am pretty much
obligated to reference this site;
<http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/> \- since everyone
else is. It is a nice, brief tutorial on what unobtrusive javascript is all
about and provides some simple examples of its use. So, if you don't know what
all the fuss is about, go check it out. Also, don't miss my example of
[unobtrusive sortable tables](http://rawlinson.us/blog/index.php?p=147).

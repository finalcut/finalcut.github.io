When storing information for an application some things obviously warrant
encryption; for example passwords. However, other elements may benefit from
encryption that might not seem so obvious.  

For instance, do you encrypt users email addresses, real names, mailing
addresses, or other tidbits?  

So, this post is more of a question than an observation - what and why do you
encrypt and why don't you encrypt other tidbits of personal identifying
information?

Hi Bill,  

You might consider picking up a book called Translucent Databases by Peter
Wayner. I've done some work with him and he's a pretty smart guy.

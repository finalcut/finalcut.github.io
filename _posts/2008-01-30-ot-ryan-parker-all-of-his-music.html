My friend Ryan is actually a fairly prolific singer songwriter and he has finally gotten all of his current songs up online at <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Parker">last.fm</a>.  That means you can listen to all of his songs - in their entirety for free.  He has two albums worth of sports songs and then an album of more <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Parker/Ryan+Parker">traditional music</a>.  <br /><br />He has also been signed by <a href="http://www.heavy.com">Heavy.com</a> to create more sports songs and videos - so you can expect a third album of sports songs to be compiled as the year goes by.</div>

Here is a screenshot of my desktop running geoshell. Personally, I love the
minimalism of it. Plus, the right click menu on the desktop makes getting to
things super easy; between that menu and GeoShell "HotKeys" I never have to
dig to launch anything.

thanks for the pointer darron. I tried litestep out a few years ago but , for
some reason, decided I didn't like it as much as geoshell.  

Both are very capable. The geoshell install process is a little easier.

I've been using litestep for ages (http://www.litestep.net/). There's an
incredible amount of themes from minimal to, well, "maximal". Plus, it has a
large amount of modules you can use. The most useful, to me, are the hoeykeys,
virtual window manager, and command-line.

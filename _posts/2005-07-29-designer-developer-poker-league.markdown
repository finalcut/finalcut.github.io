Josh Dura, the man who brought us the Designer Developer Poker Tournament, has
done it again. This time he is building a poker league for all of the
designers and developers out there. To get things going he has created a
pretty nice site at [stylebluff.com](http://www.stylebluff.com). If you like
to play poker, or just think you might like to play, you should swing over and
join the fledgling community of friendly poker players. I hope to see you
across the digital felt!

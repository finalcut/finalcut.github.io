Sorry MLK for the poor rip off of your famous quote but I'm pretty happy to
have some FIT tests running in Eclipse. If you haven't seen what FIT tests are
I encourage anyone concerned with software quality to give them a look. You
can do A LOT more than just simple tabular tests.  
  
Anyway, it took me a lot of time to get things running in Eclipse but I ended
up settling on Agilifier (the least documented tool of them all) but it is
working. I have put up a [simple tutorial and some downloadable resources on
my other blog](http://rawlinson.us/blog/eclipse-and-fit-testing/) to help
anyone else out who is trying to use FIT within Eclipse.

I just saw this link over at [Digital Media
Minute](http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/) that points to a Colour (or Color)
Contrast testing tool for the web. It is pretty slick. You enter a foreground
and background color and it will tell you if there is sufficient contrast in
the colors for accessibility. This is great when testing your site for
usability by the visually impaired and those that are color blind.

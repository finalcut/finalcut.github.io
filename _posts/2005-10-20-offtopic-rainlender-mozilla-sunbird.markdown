I have been using the Mozilla Calendar plugin for firefox to manage
appointments tasks etc for quite a while. Used in conjunction with a batch
file and an online iCal web page it has been pretty easy for me to keep my
family and friends up to date on events in my life.  

However, as nice as that combo has been I have wanted something even cleaner.
I haven't found the perfect solution yet but I think I'm getting there. Today
I downloaded the latest version of
[Rainlender](http://ipi.fi/~rainy/index.php?pn=projects&project=rainlendar)
(windows only sorry) and it supports iCal files as well (iCal is the standard
format of Mozilla Calendar and many other calendaring apps - it's a great
standard!). Anyway, Rainlender gives me even faster access to my events
because it resides on the desktop as a lightweight widget. Plus it takes care
of another problem - it provides a "task list" feature. I can point Rainlender
at my iCal files, denote some as read only, and I'm off and running. Then
using [GeoShell ](http://www.geoshell.com)(my shell replacement) and a hot key
sequence that fires my batch file I can instantly publish any changes to my
calendar.  

Pretty darn handy!

While I won't be there (I have not been to one yet) I figured some of you
might be interested in knowing about the [CFUNITED <strike>schedule</strike>
topics](http://cfunited.com/topics.cfm) that was recently published. It isn't
quite complete as a few sessions are still TBD - but overall there looks to be
some interesting topics.  

There are two in particular that I would like to be able to see; David Ross's
presentation on Coldspring and Sean Corfields on Factories (he also plans to
touch on Coldspring, Arf, and Reactor).  

This is actually the first year I have seen discussion on topics that I would
want to go and see. But 2 sessions is far from enough to warrent me, or my
employer, spending the money to send me. However, to those of you going (July
4th, 2006 weekend) - I hope you enjoy it!

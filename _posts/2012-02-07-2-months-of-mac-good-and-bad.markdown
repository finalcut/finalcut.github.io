I started using a mac two months ago after over twenty years of windows use.
However, rather than reiterate my opinion on both of my blogs (personal and
technical) I've posted the full story over on my personal blog and I'm just
putting a link to it here:  
  
<http://blog.rawlinson.us/two-months-with-a-mac-the-good-and-the-bad>  
  
I don't like cross linking like this but I hope you'll understand that this is
a topic that might be interesting to both my technical friends/followers and
my non-technical friends/family.  I hope you'll click through and read it and,
maybe even comment with some helpful tips and tricks.

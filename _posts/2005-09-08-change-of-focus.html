<div class='post'>
In using this Blog I have written about a wide variety of topics in a very casual way.  Most of the time that is sufficient for the topic but sometimes I want to present a more complete discussion of a topic; almost like an article.<br /><br />So, with that said I am going to <em>attempt</em> to start writing more in depth articles on a variety of development subjects.  They will almost all touch on ColdFusion but not all.  I will also write up a couple "unobtrusive" javascript stories and maybe some Ajax just for the heck of it.<br /><br />If I get the time I will even try to write about porting some simple applications between various platforms just to illustrate the differences (CF - PHP - Ruby) mostly.  <br /><br />I also want to be a bit more like some of the other frequent contributers to the development blog-o-sphere and release some code to the general public in a useful format.  Before I start doing that though I want to clean some of it up and present it much like Massimo did with his <a href="http://www.massimocorner.com/validator/index.htm">TMT Validator</a> (I love the way he documented his stuff).<br /><br />This means there will be fewer "opinion" pieces and more "resources" here hopefully.  Well, so long as I can stop being lazy and actually produce!</div>

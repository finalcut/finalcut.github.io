Well, I am already out of the tournament.  First out in fact.  I basically lost all of my money to "Codetroll" in two hands (I lasted 13 minutes total).<br /><br />I was actually in second place overall going into those two hands with just over 2100 chips.  In the first hand I had big slick and caught an ace on the river.  There were no table pairs or connectors, nor flush opportunities.  However, there was a ten on the board and codetroll had pocket tens.  That took me down to right around 1200.<br /><br />Two hands later I caught a club flush on the river.  I had queen high.  Codetroll flopped a 3 and 6 of clubs for a straight flush.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say I was all in with my great flush as there was noway anyone had a full house or a four of a kind.<br /><br />Ahh well, such is the game that is poker.  Now, at this point, I hope codetroll wins.  Damn him!<br /><br />UPDATE: It turns out codetroll did win.  It took about 3.6 hours but that means I came in last and second :O) (sorta!)</div>

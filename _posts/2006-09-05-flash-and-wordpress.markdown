I am about to begin a new project where I will be building a Flash Front End
to a wordpress blog.  
  
I have only made one, very poor, flash movie before (back in 1998) and I don't
really remember any of the process. My interface between wordpress and flash,
I think, will be written in PHP. I will try to post some do's and do nots as I
go through the process.  
  
Wish me luck!

An integration of a Wordpress "back-end" with a Flash "front-end"  
By aggregating RSS feeds, a Flash-based interface generated out of snippets of
posts and web pages into a booklet / brochure like format  
This combines the straight-forward approach of browsing a physical brochure or
booklet, while fully enjoying and comprehending the visuals and concepts of
the site.  
The changes to the Wordpress installation are incredibly minimal, amounting
only to an upgrade to a single installation file, and an uploading of a Flash
(.SWF) file, along with its HTML holder.  
  
Simply putting it - your Wordpress or any other website that provides RSS
feeds, can be shaped like the following front-end.

I'm about to try the same thing, I thought I'd let you know about Lee
Brimlow's mysql-php-flash tutorial at gotoandlearn.com, it's pretty simple and
informative. I don't think I will try full inegration with the api, etc.
tough. I like using my new ipod to make posts.

Thank you Ray!  
  
I have been looking all over for this . I am trying to build a front end flash
site for my wife and be able to dynamically post messages to her blog that
will show up in the flash!

Ray

something like that has been achieved:

Greg thanks for the info - and the link - that site is very nicely done
(tvwonline.net that is).

The nicest Flash blog ui I have seen yet is here:

If you last used Flash in 1998 it doesn't matter if you "don't really remember
any of the process." Flash has evolved so dramatically you will be doing
everything very differently anyway.  
  
btw ... Flex may provide a better development process for you than Flash.
Either way you get a swf and the mechanics of most of the data components are
the same.  
  
For PHP/Flash/Flex integration you might find some good background material
here:

Umm... I don't know that flash and blogs are really good frineds. I say that
for two reasons, 1. Flash takes a lot longer to load than plain HTML and 2. It
breaks google indexing. So unless you can work around those two things I
wouldn't make a blog that is entirely flash, but that is just my two cents

i have thought about this off and on for a little while... excited to see what
you come out with.  
  
my main thinking was being able to turn it off and on in the presentation tab
of the wpadmin console, since it really is just a presentation layer.  
  
good luck! ... let me know if i can be of any help...

I have looked into doing this as well. The simple answer is to just use
Wordpress as you normally would, but instead using an alternative directory
that renders the content and interface directly from the RSS feeds through
flash - and the html version is never seen.

Good luck!  
  
And lots of patience as well!

that sounds cool, something i've always wanted to do.  
  
Just to give you a jumpstart, you can find some info about using XML-RPC for
hooking into wordpress's API here: http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support
, and there's a link on that page where someone had wrote some php scripts to
help with that: http://www.dentedreality.com.au/bloggerapi/

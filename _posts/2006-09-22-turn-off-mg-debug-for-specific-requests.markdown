It's funny how when one person is looking for an answer to a problem it seems
a bunch of other people are looking for the same thing, at the same time. As
it turns out this is exactly what happened to me today.

I was working on creating a MG app that has some "AJAXy" goodness in it. I
want to leave the MG debug stuff on while I'm working (sometimes) but never
want it to output in an "XML" view (that which is returned to the AJAX
request). I figured it had to be possible and sure enough some other people
were just [asking Ray Camden a couple days
ago](http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/8/22/Using-AJAX-with-
ModelGlue).

Thankfully, Jan Jannek, posted a comment reply with the answer:

```cfc
<cfset request.modelGlueSuppressDebugging = true />

```

Just stick that code in your XML view and debug output won't be shown. Ray
also posted a [blog entry](http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/9/18
/Per-request-debugging-in-ModelGlue) that covers this. I'm just recovering the
topic in case anyone missed this then.

I found this post today via another blog (Mac OSX Code i think) and while it
doesn't relate directly to CF or development I thought it was interesting
enough to share the link:

I don't remember the source, but I heard about an experiment where they did
this with teachers. They told them that half of the class was gifted and the
other half was normal even though everyone in the class was the same. The
teachers consistently graded the "gifted" students better.

Thanks for linking to that post of mine. The new url for the site is
http://www.productivity501.com, but the old links should transfer through for
at least a few more months.

Very interesting. So if you have kids, you can make them do better in school
by telling their teachers that they are gifted with a very high iq....
Couldn't hurt to try.y

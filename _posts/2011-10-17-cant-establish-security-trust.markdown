If you are ever working on a project for the US Govt and are accessing some
site within their network (via a VPN) and you start to get security and trust
relationship errors then you need to install the DoD certificates. I found
them at this [US Army Corps of Engineers
Website](http://epfat.swf.usace.army.mil/Welcome.aspx). I downloaded the zip
file, ran the installer, and all of my trust problems with the government were
resolved.

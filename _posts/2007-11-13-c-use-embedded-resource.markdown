I recently had the need to embed a few xml files into a project and wanted to
write a wrapper class that would deal with these embedded resources. I'm lazy
though and didn't want much cruft around them so I wanted a very simple method
for getting the resource and returning it as an XmlDocument - or null if it
wasn't found.

My other code will use the XmlDocument or not even show a form field if the
returned value is null.

**I made some minor changes to the following code so that you can see what references I'm using and I'm getting the Assembly via reflection now.**

Here is the code for fetching the resource:

```c#
using System.Reflection;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml;

public XmlDocument GetResource(string resourceCode){
  XmlDocument xml = null
  try{
    string filePath = "Com.MyDomain.MyProject.Resources" + resourceCode + ".xml";
    Stream fileStream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(filePath);
    if (fileStream != null) {
      xml = new XmlDocument();
      xml.Load(fileStream);
    }
  } catch {
    // if anything goes wrong I don't care - just return a null object.
  }
  return xml;
}

```

You can use the following code to determine if you are online or not:


```c#
using System.Net.NetworkInformation;


...



public static bool IsOnline()
{
  bool isConnected = false;
  NetworkInterface[] adapters = NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces();
  foreach (NetworkInterface n in adapters)
  {
    if (n.OperationalStatus == OperationalStatus.Up && n.NetworkInterfaceType != NetworkInterfaceType.Loopback)
    {
    // Since we have a non loopback interface up, we have a network connection
    isConnected = true;
    break;
    }
  }
  return isConnected;
}

```


Update: I added a "break" to the loop so that I exit as soon as I find a good
connection.

Thanks Paul.

Here are [the documentation for
GetIsNetworkAvailable](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.net

There is a more simple way:

bool isNetworkAvailable =
System.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable();

ignore me, I read it wrong :D

That function will only tell you if the last adapter in your collection is
online.

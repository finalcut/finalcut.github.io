For a long time I have been posting really ugly code snippets on this blog but
thankfully, as of today, that is no longer a problem. Thanks to this post
about a [syntaxhighlighter javascript](http://yacoding.blogspot.com/2008/05
/how-to-add-syntax-highlight-to-blogger.html) and this other guys "[coldfusion
brush](http://blog.tech-cats.com/2007/10/syntax-highlighting-for-
coldfusion.html)" for the same script my site now has nicely formatted and
highlighted code.  
  
The script is called
[SyntaxHighlighter](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) and it works
very well, even with blogger blogs like this one. I am now highlighting all of
my CF, PHP, RUBY, Javascript, C#, SQL, and Java code exampmles. It may take a
while for me to go back through my old posts and update the code but I'll get
there eventually.  
  
The first link in this post has nice instructions for setting up the script.
The CF brush is a little hidden but he has a link right to the actual [brushes
compressed source](http://opensourceprojects.googlecode.com/svn/dpSyntaxHighli
ghterColdFusionBrush/trunk/compressed/shBrushColdFusion.js) as well.

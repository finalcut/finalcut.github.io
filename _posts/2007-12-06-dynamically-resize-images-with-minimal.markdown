Some smart guys have come up with a technique for resizing images while
minimizing the artifacts. This is either really cool or a great hoax. I
haven't read the PDF yet but the video is really amazing and seems pretty
convincing. [Check out the video](http://www.seamcarving.com/).  
  
Here is a [flash implementation](http://www.zeropointnine.com/blog/seam-
carving-in-as3-with-source) of it so I assume it is a valid technique. If you
have used it let me know if it has worked as well for you as the video
implies.

There is a flash demo at http://rsizr.com/ that is OK but doesn't respond well
to large images.

Thanks - it is pretty amazing really. That bit on the beach where the guys
just get zapped out of the image was incredible.

Yes this is real and Adobe has since acquired the guy. He gave a great live
demonstration of seam carving/editing at Adobe Max 2007 in Chicago.  
  
I'm sure this technology is bound to be implemented into Adobe technologies in
the near future.

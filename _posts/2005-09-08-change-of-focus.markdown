In using this Blog I have written about a wide variety of topics in a very
casual way. Most of the time that is sufficient for the topic but sometimes I
want to present a more complete discussion of a topic; almost like an article.  

So, with that said I am going to _attempt_ to start writing more in depth
articles on a variety of development subjects. They will almost all touch on
ColdFusion but not all. I will also write up a couple "unobtrusive" javascript
stories and maybe some Ajax just for the heck of it.  

If I get the time I will even try to write about porting some simple
applications between various platforms just to illustrate the differences (CF
- PHP - Ruby) mostly.  

I also want to be a bit more like some of the other frequent contributers to
the development blog-o-sphere and release some code to the general public in a
useful format. Before I start doing that though I want to clean some of it up
and present it much like Massimo did with his [TMT
Validator](http://www.massimocorner.com/validator/index.htm) (I love the way
he documented his stuff).  

This means there will be fewer "opinion" pieces and more "resources" here
hopefully. Well, so long as I can stop being lazy and actually produce!

Taking exceptionally simple markup and creating 40 different and highly usable
layouts is no easy feat. But Alessandro Fulciniti has done just that (this guy
knows his CSS). So swing by his "[layout
gala](http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/)" the next time you want to start off
with a nice CSS based layout.  
  
Nobody can say using a CSS based layout is too hard anymore. Half the job is
done for you.

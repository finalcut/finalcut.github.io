If you are wondering why your website loads slowly, and you use firebug to
help debug your site in firefox already - then you should try out this great
addon to [firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) provided by Yahoo! called
[YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/).  
  
If you don't use firebug yet - then you really should - it's fantastic.

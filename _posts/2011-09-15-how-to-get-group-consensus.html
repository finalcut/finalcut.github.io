This is a post I started writing a few years ago (March 2008) but never published for some reason...<br /><br />I don't have any first hand experience with the KJ Technique but it sounds pretty promising.&nbsp; I can't explain it as well as this linked article does so I'll just send you there.&nbsp; However, if you have already used this technique (or something like it) and have some feedback I'd love it if you left a comment.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/kj_technique/">The KJ-Technique: A Group Process for Establishing Priorities</a><br />I actually came across this article via Assaf Arkin's blog <a href="http://blog.labnotes.org/2008/03/23/rounded-corners-198-less-is-the-new-black/">Labnotes</a>.  I just started reading his blog last week so it's already paid off in introducing me to this new concept.&nbsp; Thanks Assaf.  <br /><br />As I started reading the article on the KJ Technique I couldn't help but continually think about Assaf's idea of building this as a web service.&nbsp; Well, actually, it kept focusing on potential UI designs for really bringing the power of the technique to a web-based application.&nbsp; My conclusion? I'm not very good at UI design!&nbsp; My focus was more on how to bring this concept to a distributed team without need of some kind of teleconference.&nbsp; How can you simulate the sticky-notes that can be grouped - or regrouped by different non-directly-communicating team members? If you can come up with a good UI that clearly communicates the shift of a sticky from one group to another (or a total merging of groups) by a remote user to all other users in the group it would be fantastic.&nbsp; In fact, if it was really clear what was going on all the time and everyone could keep messing with the virtual sticky-notes I almost think a distributed version of the KJ-Technique would be better than the one described in the article because it would really help enforce the "no discussion" rule for the first 2/3's of the process.</div>

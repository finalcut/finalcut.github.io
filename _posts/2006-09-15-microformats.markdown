I have to admit I've been a bit slow on the uptake with microformats. However,
the more I have read about them the more sense they make to me. However, due
to the lack of readily available tools that make use of microformats they may
still take a while before they get more widespread adoption. If you are like
me and need more info on microformats check out "[The Big Picture on
Microformats](http://www.digital-
web.com/articles/the_big_picture_on_microformats/).  

I currently use two different tools that deal specifically with microformats.
The first, [Structured Blogging](http://structuredblogging.org) (site was down
when I wrote this), is a wordpress plugin that makes it easy to create content
in microformats. The second, [Tails 0.3.4](http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-
firefox-extension-03/), is a firefix extension that makes it easy for me to
extract microformat information from webpages.  

I tried a couple of earlier version of Tails (and flocktails and tails export)
but there was one bug in them that was a showstopper. Basically it messed up
the tab cycling feature in firefox so that if you hit ctrl+tab it would cycle
two tabs instead of just one. Fortunately, that is fixed in 0.3.4 and it is
pretty capable of handling a variety of different microformats.  

I think the two microformats that I might have the most use for, currently, as
a consumer are [hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) and
[hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard).  

Here are a couple links that deal specificially with microformats or how to
use them:

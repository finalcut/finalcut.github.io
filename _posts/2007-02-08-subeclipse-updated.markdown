A few months ago I updated Tortoise SVN which, subsequently, broke
<strike>Subeclipse</strike>Subclipse (the Ecplise SVN plugin) due to a change
in the way SVN in general worked with the Tortoise update. No biggie I figured
I could just use Tortoise SVN alone until <strike>Subeclipse</strike>Subclipse
was updated. Lo and behold I found out today (thanks to [someone else's
blog](http://nil.checksite.co.uk/index.cfm/2007/2/8/Subclipse-update)) that
<strike>Subeclipse</strike>Subclipse had an update available.  
  
It fixed the problem. Hooray!  
  
If you are using <strike>Subeclipse</strike>Subclipse but don't have the
update site in Eclipse you can [get it
here](http://subclipse.tigris.org/#subclipse). They have information on
updating regardless of what version of Eclipse you are using.

Thanks for the correction mark. I will update my post to reflect it.

I do not know if you looked for the update before and did not find it, but if
you did it might have been because the project is named Subclipse, not
Subeclipse.

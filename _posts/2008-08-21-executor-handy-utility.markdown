Yesterday I was browsing around when I came across the nifty app launching
utility called [Executor](http://executor.dk/). Executor is sort of like
"[Launchy](http://www.launchy.net)" but has a few differences. First off it
doesn't support plugins like Launchy. It also doesn't have as much of a fan
base. However, I like it better. It has a bunch of nice features and does
everything I want it to do.  
  
There are a bunch of
"[secret](http://home25.inet.tele.dk/mb/executor/didyouknow.html)" commands
and [options](http://home25.inet.tele.dk/mb/executor/hidden.html) in it as
well. You might be wondering why I like it better than Launchy? Sadly, that
isn't easy to answer. Executor just behaves the way I want. It seems to offer
me more default options and is pretty darn customizable. It supports hotkeys
(which I pretty much love having) for quick application launching. It is more
keyword based than Launchy and overall just seems a bit more powerful in it's
base configuration.  
  
I don't really need GCal or Twitter or any other web based social media
integration with my app launcher - I just want an easy to use and powerful
command line tool and Executor fits the bill nicely.

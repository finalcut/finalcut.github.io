I just came across a link to a Ruby version of the web book "Data Structures
and Algorithms" which looks very promising. However, what is even better is
that the author, Bruno Preis, has written the same book in 8 different
languages: [C++](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus4/),
[Java](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus5),
[C#](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus6),
[Python](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus7),
[Ruby](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus8),
[Lua](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus9),
[Perl](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus10), and
[PHP](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus11).  
  
Sure, for the CF readers here he is leaving you out - but it is pretty easy to
translate PHP code into equivilant CF code; plus you can always just use the
Java if you want. Hopefully some of you find this educational and, better yet,
interesting!

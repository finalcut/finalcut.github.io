While I think I will rarely have a reason to post via this method to  
this blog I figured I would enable the feature. Now, whenever I'm on  
the go and I want to blog some cool new insight or technique (or  
whatever) I can do so via email.

It should enable me to post more regularly - since my email app is  
always open and I don't have to load a new page - but I can't really  
promise anything because a lot of times I just forget to blog stuff I  
think is interesting. But, since blogger offers the feature, I  
figured I might as well try to use it.

This post is my first effort at posting via Email.

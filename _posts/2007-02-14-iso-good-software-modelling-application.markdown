I don't need anything fancy. I don't want to spend any money. But I would like
a decent software modeling program - something I can use to draw UML diagrams
specifically.  
  
I'd be happy if it just amounted to a set of shapes for OpenOffice draw, or
was a plugin for Eclipse. However these aren't a requirement. I can always
fall back to MS and reinstall Visio (we have a company license, but I'd prefer
not to - just because I'm stubborn about MS Office).  
  
If you have any suggestions or recommendations please leave a comment!  
  
Thanks

thanks - another one I am looking at is [umlet](http://www.umlet.com)  
  
The website sucks, the documentation is horrible, but it looks like it will do
the job quickly and easily.  
  
If you decide to look at it just note that you have to have JVM 1.5 installed
(at the command line type java -version to see what version you have).

You could use either [argouml](http://argouml.tigris.org/) or [dia](http
://dia-installer.sourceforge.net/).  
Both are free.

Have you tried Dia?  
  
http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/  
  
It's similar to Visio...

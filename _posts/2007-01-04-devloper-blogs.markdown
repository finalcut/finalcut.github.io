There are a ton of blogs about software development out there. Some are just
repositories of trivial tips (much like this blog) but some are great and
should be read by a wide audience. One blog I put in this category is
[Raganwald](http://weblog.raganwald.com/) \- a blog by a pretty insightful guy
in Vancouver (I think). I've been reading his blog for about a year now and he
consistently produces thought provoking entries. If you are a software
developer (it doesn't matter what tools you use) you should at least take a
look at his blog - you will probably find a few entries that get you thinking
in new ways.  
  
If you don't, because everything he says to you is old hat, and you have a
blog, let me know about it so I can learn from both of you.

Thanks, I'm very flattered. My first glance at "In the Trenches" makes me want
to sit down and read the entire blog, post by post. Nice!  
  
p.s. I'm actually in Toronto at the moment.

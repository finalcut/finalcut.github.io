Anyone who even casually reads my blog knows I talk about software development
and occasionally interject a little bit of sports. This is a bit of the later.
I found [this blog](http://thebandwagonfan.blogspot.com) by a sports fan who
is painfully honest. He is the epitome of a fairweather fan - and he claims
the title proudly. His posts are laced with delusions, hope, and quick
dismissal of his teams that lose. It is a new blog but should be a fun,
occasional distraction. Check out [The Bandwagon Fan](http://thebandwagonfan.blogspot.com).  

It will be interesting to see who his new "favorite" football team is.

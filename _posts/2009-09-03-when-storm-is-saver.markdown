Today I found a great tool for testing webservices called Storm. It's a free,
open source tool that basically just kicks ass. You can call any webservice
and pass along some pretty complicated arguments to it if you want and quickly
get a feel for what's going wrong (or right!)  
  
While, sadly the exception information returned from my CF webservice wasn't
very useful Storm made it easy for me to confirm the problem existed in both
DEV and Production and it made it super easy for me to test the patch on the
PROD server to make sure the problem was resolved.  
  
It's free, has no installation at all, and works like a charm. You can get it
at [The Storm Homepage](http://storm.codeplex.com/). I just installed r1.1
Adarna standalone.  
  
I highly recommend you try it out

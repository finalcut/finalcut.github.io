Well I've been using winamp with the ipod plugin all day and I have to say I
like it and, more than likely, it is now my default audio player again. I'm
not going to say alot more than I did before but here are some reasons why I
like it more:  

  1. Ratings Sync - it actually works in both directions. Very sweet
  2. Pull Music off my iPod - always handy
  3. MUCH SMALLER MEMORY FOOTPRINT
As you can see I think alot of #3.  

In fact those numbers show winamp playing songs directly from my shuffle and
iTunes doing nothing but sitting there. It isn't connected to the store, my
ipod, or anything. Just an idle iTunes takes up 3x as much memory as active
winamp with a song playing, playlist open, and the eq open and active. Whats
up with that?  

So, if you haven't done it yet and you use an iPod on windows you should
consider [winamp](http://winamp.com) with the
[ml_pod](http://winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=138888) plugin.

good question - and I doubt it. Though, with the release of apples network
stuff ([bonjour](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows_read
me.html) for windows recently I'm sure he could add it.  

It just isn't a feature I ever used in iTunes so I didn't even notice it
missing.

Sounds good but no sharing?

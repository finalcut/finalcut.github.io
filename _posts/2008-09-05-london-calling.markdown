Early next month I might be going to London for work; however, as you know all
work and no play makes a dull boy. Thus, I am looking for some
cool/interesting places to visit while I'm there.  
  
I know London is huge and there is a ton to do so I need to kind of filter
things down since I can only do stuff other than work on a Sunday and
weeknights. I'll be there with a few other guys between the 4th and the 10th
of Oct (If I go).  
  
So, please drop a comment or suggestion on things I can do.

description: How I am sharing my blog postings to bluesky using a github action.
---
I really want to share my blog posts to Bluesky but I'm lazy and don't want to copy/paste if I can get a computer to do it for me.  So I've been digging into how to do that via a github action.  I'll update this post with info as I get it working.

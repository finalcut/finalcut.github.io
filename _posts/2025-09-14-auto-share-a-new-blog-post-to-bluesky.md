description: How I am sharing my blog postings to bluesky using a github action.
---
I really want to share my blog posts to Bluesky but I'm lazy and don't want to copy/paste if I can get a computer to do it for me.  So I've been digging into how to do that via a github action.  I'll update this post with info as I get it working.

One of the things Also working on is having AI generate a nice description of the post beyond the short little descriptive text I provide. 

At this point I have the bluesky posting working, the AI is not.  Updating the blog post the bluesky url is also not working so far.

Things not working great yet:

 -[ ] AI not generating post text
 -[ ] getting the github action to update the post and commit it back to git with the post url

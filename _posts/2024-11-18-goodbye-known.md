# What's Up?
For years I have had many blogs.  My primary blog has been at rawlinson.us and was powered by a variety of engines over time, the last of which was [Known](https://withknown.com/).  Known is cool and all but I wasn't doing a good job of keeping it updated. I also wasn't doing a great job with maintaining the server powering and it was just becoming toil in my life.

## ~No~ Less Toil
I think it should be pretty obvious that toil in ones life is not good.  My job is focused on removing toil so it seems silly I wouldn't apply that here. So, farewell Known; you were good while I knew ya!

Using Jekyll imparts its own toil but, hopefully, it will be less than I had with Known.

# Missing Content
My old blog at rawlinson.us and my blog that was at code.rawlinson.us and my other one at bits.rawlinson.us all had varying content. I had tried to keep family stuff on the main one, work stuff on `code` and funny random stuff at `bits`.  I'm giving up on that separation and, in so doing, giving up on moving all that old content.  Some of it might catch up here; but its doubtful.

# This URL
Currently the site is at code.rawlinson.us; I'll might change it. I'm not sure. For now blog.rawlinson.us, www.rawlinson.us, bits.rawlinson.us, books.rawlinson.us and rawlinson.us all redirect here (I think).  Note, books and bits may not work at all at the moment.  Certificate needs to be updated.

Sure this post is late to the game - but c'est la vie. Really, this isn't a
post anyway - it's just a link to someone else's post - a post that clearly
and simply explains what MapReduce is and why it is useful. If you are already
familiar with map reduce - move along there is nothing to see here. However,
if you only have a vague notion about it - or don't understand it at all -
then please proceed to "[MapReduce for Mere
Mortals](http://hamletdarcy.blogspot.com/2008/01/mapreduce-for-mere-
mortals.html)"

I just saw this over on tinks' blog via the 'Goog. It is a really cool website
that has a ton of different api's available via one interface. Check out
[gotAPI.com](http://www.gotapi.com/).  

**note** this is an old blog post and that site is no longer available

Very cool stuff. Why haven't I heard about it before?

I was just reading my most recent edition of [Software Development
Times](http://www.sdtimes.com) (SDTimes) and came across an interesting
graphic. I only post this because it immediately reminded me of [Jared Rypka-
Hauer's rant against PHP](http://www.web-
relevant.com/blogs/cfobjective/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=2F7C602C-
BDB9-5320-EB50C1461F58460F).  

It seems that PHP, Perl, and Python have experienced a pretty severe drop in
usage in Eurpoe, the Middle East, and Africa over the past year. Each with
over a 20% decline in usage (statistics provided by [Evans Data
Corp](http://www.evansdata.com))!  

The key quote from the article seems to be:  

> John Andrews, COO Evans Data"One of the key factors for this loss of
developer mindshare has been the inability of these languages to penetrate the
enterprise space"



I wonder what their survey result said about non-open scripting languages such
as Coldfusion?  

Notes:  



  * Even though CF is tag based I still consider it the equivilant of a scripting language


  * Additional Data is avaiable via Evans Data Corp on what appears as a for-sale only basis so I have no insight into the CF usage patterns

Pete - like Treach', I think a lot are switching to RoR. That or Java/.NET,
which IMO are more "stable" than PHP positions.

I think the more interesting question is what are PHP, Python, and Perl users
switching to?

I have stopped using PHP as well. I think people are seeing there are better
ways to do things out there. PHP is the quick and easy fix. It is a remarkable
tool for developing web applications but I have since moved on to my new
infactuation [ruby on rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) which may be the most
productive web framework and most interesting language I have developed in to
date.

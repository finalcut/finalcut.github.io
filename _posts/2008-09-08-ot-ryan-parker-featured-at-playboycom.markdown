Surprise surprise - my friend Ryan Parker's song writing caught the eye of
some folks at Playboy.com and they had him make a video, "[Bristol's Mom Has
Got It Goin On](http://videoarticles.playboy.com/?fr_story=68cf5735a9930ac4933
dc939670f97d55ff30f44&rf=bm)" which is a bit of a political satire about Gov
Palin.  
  
Funny, I never really thought my tech blog would have a link to playboy on it.

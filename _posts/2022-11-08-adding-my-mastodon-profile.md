# What's Up?
In order to link my mastodon account and my blog I've added a mastodon icon to the footer.  It's just a circle because I'm using an old font-awesome and I don't have a better icon to use.

The key is that it has a rel="me" attribute that points to my profile on mastodon (my instance is hacyderm.io) like so: <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@finalcut">https://hachyderm.io/@finalcut</a>

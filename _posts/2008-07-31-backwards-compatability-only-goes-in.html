<div class='post'>
This is just a little story of a stupid moment by me.  This morning I was working on some stuff for a client when a weird error popped up.  The error occurred after I had updated the client library side of a client server pair to be at version 2; the server, however, is at version 1.3.<br /><br />Version 2 is supposed to be backwards compatible with 1.3 but it wasn't working.  It seemed crazy; I even asked someone else to look at it and he too was stumped. From the subject line you have probably already identified the problem.  The Server side is backward compatible with clients running 1.3.  There is no way the server, which was running 1.3, could be forward compatible with 2.0 clients.  Duh.<br /><br />I'm such a moron sometimes.</div>

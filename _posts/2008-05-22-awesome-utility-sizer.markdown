I do most of my work lately via a remote desktop that is accessed via Citrix
client over the web. My system has a dual screen setup where my laptop screen
is a higher resolution than my secondary LCD. The Citrix client, does a nice
job of spanning both screens. However, any application within the Citrix
client, when maximized, also spans across both screens. This is far less than
ideal considering I don't really want a gap in the middle of the application
I'm trying to use. It also makes it hard to quickly resize the various apps I
have running for efficiency.  
  
Enter "[Sizer](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer.html)" a free little application
that integrates nicely with the windows shell. It basically adds a right click
context menu to any window that lets you resize and reposition a window to
your specifications. I configured it to have a "left" and a "right" setting.
If I pick "left" on a window it jumps to the maximum size for my laptop
monitor and repositions to Top=0, left=0. If I pick right it resizes to the
max size of my external monitor and repositions to Top=0, Left=width of laptop
monitor+1.  
  
It's really fantastic and has already proven to be an invaluable and
irreplaceable resource for me while working remotely.

I fixed the link - sorry about that. I wash pointing to the .com domain and
not the correct .net domain.

The link doesn't seem to work and even the domain looks inactive.

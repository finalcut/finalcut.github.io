Sorry for the offtopic post, but I thought this was pretty cool.

Everytime I get ready to take a trip we muck around with all sorts of travel
sites like travelocity, travel.yahoo.com, expedia, orbitz, etc. Well, it looks
like Yahoo is about to raise the bar a level by building one site that
searches across all of them. I don't know how many different sites it will
search but <http://farechase.yahoo.com/> looks pretty darn cool - and gives
you alot of great options to pick from. Plus, not only will it search for
outgoing flights at the airport you select, but it will search at geographical
close airports as well. For instance when I did a search from Huntington WV it
also searched out of Charleston as well and, as it turns out, the fare was
significantly cheaper leaving from Charleston. What a time saver!

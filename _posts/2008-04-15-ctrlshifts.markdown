Hey, some I'm a little (ok a LOT) slow. But I accidentally discovered the
keyboard shortcut of "CTRL+SHIFT+S" inside Firefox with the web developer
toolbar installed.  
  
Quick, before you look - what do you think it does? If you guessed view the
current pages style sheets in a new tab then you're a winner! Sorry, no prizes
though.  
  
I have probably used that feature of the toolbar hundreds of times in the past
- but I never really noticed the keyboard shortcut.  
  
I love looking at the CSS for any page that looks really good. I almost always
learn something (even if it is that I am not as good at CSS as I'd like to be)
and, now, thanks to a fat fingered "Copy" I am able to see the pages style
faster than ever before.

I didn't know that one either. Though, honestly, I rarely want to open a
recently closed tab. I've probably needed to do so 2 or 3 times since Firefox
gave me the ability.  
  
This isn't becuase I am good about closing tabs only after due diliberation -
but rather becuase I never close any tabs so I end up with tons of tabs open
at once.  
  
I'm more likely to close the browser by accident than a specific tab :O)  
  
Thanks for sharing though.

You know the shortcut CTRL-SHIFT-T for firefox? A real life saver, it reopens
the last closed tab :)

My friend Ryan is actually a fairly prolific singer songwriter and he has
finally gotten all of his current songs up online at
[last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Parker). That means you can listen to
all of his songs - in their entirety for free. He has two albums worth of
sports songs and then an album of more [traditional
music](http://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Parker/Ryan+Parker).  
  
He has also been signed by [Heavy.com](http://www.heavy.com) to create more
sports songs and videos - so you can expect a third album of sports songs to
be compiled as the year goes by.

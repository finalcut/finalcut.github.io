As hard as it might be to believe I do a lot of other things beyond writing
and hacking at code. I play a ton of sports but, to stay true to my geek
stereotype I also read a lot. I mostly read speculative fiction (fantasy, not
much sci-fi), military fiction, and a bunch of non-fiction and now I've
started [my own blog to talk about those
books](http://billthebookcritic.blogspot.com/).  
  
Recently I also started reading a bunch of review blogs and, truth be told, I
think the idea is pretty cool. I've written a few book reviews on my personal
blog before but I had never really thought of devoting a blog to just the
books I read. Now, however, I have decided to give it a go. I've not had much
experience writing reviews while not spoiling the books so at the moment my
reviews are definitely far more about my impression of the book as opposed to
what takes place in it. Hopefully that format will be interesting to some
readers.  
  
If you happen to visit [my new review
blog](http://billthebookcritic.blogspot.com/) please drop a comment and let me
know if the review is useful or not. Either way any suggestions or advice on
what might make the reviews better would be great.  
  
Here are some of the other sites I've been visiting/reading:

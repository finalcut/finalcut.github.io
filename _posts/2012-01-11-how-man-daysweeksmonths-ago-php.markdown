Yesterday I wrote a simple wordpress plugin that checks an rss feed and finds
posts in that feed that contain specific keywords.  Any posts found that are
also younger than n number of days are then displayed at the top of a page
just as if they were posts in the wordpress blog.



When I was display the data though I thought it would be nice if the pubdate
sent with the feed actually showed up as "2 days ago..." or "4 months ago.."
or whatever was applicable.  Thus, I did what any good lazy coder does I
googled to see if anyone had written this up in PHP already and sure enough
someone had.



I found this function on the [drupal support community message boards posted
by someone named "drenei"](http://drupal.org/node/61565#comment-198230)



```php

   <?php

   function ago($timestamp){

   $difference = time() - $timestamp;

   $periods = array("second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", "years", "decade");

   $lengths = array("60","60","24","7","4.35","12","10");

   for($j = 0; $difference >= $lengths[$j]; $j++)

   $difference /= $lengths[$j];

   $difference = round($difference);

   if($difference != 1) $periods[$j].= "s";

   $text = "$difference $periods[$j] ago";

   return $text;

  }

   ?>


```

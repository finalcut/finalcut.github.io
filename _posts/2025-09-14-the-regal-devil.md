This amazing caterpillar was crawling across a creek bed yesterday.  It is a Hickory Horned Devil - and it transforms into a Regal Moth aka the Royal Walnut Moth.

This caterpillar was at least 5" long and maybe 3/4" across. Definitely the biggest caterpillar I've ever seen!  You can learn more about this beautiful specimen on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citheronia_regalis

<div class='post'>
I just updated the sites feed to be published by feedburner instead of the normal blogspot feed.  This shouldn't have any impact on my few (if any) subscribers but I thought I should give a heads up.<br /><br />I'm also including, at least as a temporary trial, google adsense in the new feed.  If it seems like a pain in the ass or is too distracting, or if my few (if any) readers complain about it then I'll remove it.<br /><br />Sorry for this totally meta post.</div>

I know this has nothing to do with CF or development in general - but I wanted
to share a funny song.  

My friend, [Ryan Parker, is a pretty good
singer/songwriter](http://ryanparkersongs.com/) who is also a huge Bengals
fan. He has been a fan of the Bengals for pretty much his entire life and has
followed them through all the crappy years upto this point where he has a
moment of glory. However, he is distrubed that he is forced to share the
moment with so many fair-weather fans who suddenly love his team. In honor of
the wannabe's he recorded a new song - [Bengal
Bandwagon](http://ryanparkersongs.com/). It's a great track and well worth a
listen even if you aren't a Bengals fan because you can laugh at the bad years
the Bengals had as well as appreciate what they have accomplished recently.

I doubt if you will see that I replied to your comment. However, if you do..  

I don't have any picks or prognostications to share from earlier in the
season. In fact I put very few non-tech posts on this blog.  

However, next year I will (if I remember too) I will put them up on my more
personal blog (rawlinson.us/blog) so that my guesses will be as open to review
as yours were this year.

responded to your comment.  

do you have a "prognosticator" that didn't have both hits and misses in their
predictions at week 2 in the season? no one has a job for actually predicting
the future.

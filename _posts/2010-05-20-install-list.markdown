My work laptop has been having some problems lately so I am moving to a
temporary machine until a new one is in the budget. As I do this I wanted to
record what software I need to have installed on my machine in order to get my
daily work done:  
  

  * [Coldfusion Server](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/) \- I installed 9 but none of my customers use it. Most are using 7 and a couple are using 8. I already ran into a couple incompatibilities, especially with my session facade becuase it used an undocumented feature of getPageContext(). Now I use getPageContext["session"] instead of getPageContext().getBuildinScopes()["session"] - I'll blog about that a little more later.  

  * [Editplus](http://editplus.com/) \- this is still my absolutely favorite text editor though I really dislike the tree control in the file explorer. It is buggy even if the developer doesn't agree.
  * [Dropbox ](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE0MzQzMTk)\- this auto installs for me both KeyPass AND Executor which are awesome utilities. I don't know how I survive without DropBox - it rocks.
  * Oracle 10 client - I may need the Oracle 9 client too - but I hope not.
  * [Java 5 SDK ](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp)\- The install yesterday was a bit different than what I remembered but it worked.
  * [Ant 1.7](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) \- I also need a bunch of extra libraries like ant-contrib, mxunit-ant, svnant, and a couple others.
  * [Apache 2](http://httpd.apache.org/) \- I run Apache 2.0.55 so I installed the exact same version on the temp machine just because I knew I could port my conf file more easily.
  * [Coldspring ](http://www.coldspringframework.org/)\- some of my coldfusion apps need it.
  * [ModelGlue ](http://model-glue.com/)\- some of my coldfusion apps need it.
  * [mxunit ](http://www.mxunit.org/)\- I can't do coldfusion development without my trusty unit test framework. This thing just works and it works well.
  * [PL/SQL Developer](http://www.allroundautomations.com/plsqldev.html) \- Oracle could learn so much from these guys on how to create a useful too.
  * [Chrome ](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel)\- I like chrome and it is my browser of choice - though I use the dev channel build which often gives me odd problems. The built-in bookmark sync is pretty awesome too.  

  * [Firefox ](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html)and [Firebug ](http://getfirebug.com/)\- You can't really do any serious web front end development without firebug IMHO.
  * [Thunderbird ](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/)\- My favorite email application is even better with paired with [lightning ](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/)and the google calendar connector.
  * [Malware Bytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org/) \- I like to have this already installed on any computer; just in case.
  * [MediaMonkey ](http://www.mediamonkey.com/)\- ok, so I don't NEED this to be installed but I sure do love it.   

  * MS SQL Server - I am holding off on installing this but I'll need to have it before too long.
  * [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner) \- an nifty utility for maintaining my computer. Just beware of the annoying toolbars and other things it tries to install with it.
  * [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) \- great and free FTP client
  * [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) \- great and free zip compression utility
  * [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/) \- great and free IM client
  * [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)
  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
  * [SyncBack](http://www.2brightsparks.com/downloads.html) \- Awesome, awesome, awesome free tool for synchronizing two directory trees.   

  * [ExpanDrive](http://www.expandrive.com/windows) \- a nifty cloud-based harddrive service. A long time ago I signed up for a deal with [TextDrive](http://www.joyent.com/) (now Joyent) which gave me a lifetime account to a few things; one was strongspace. [Strongspace](http://www.strongspace.com), last year was sold to ExpanDrive, so my lifetime account moved to them. It's sort of like Dropbox but isn't as seamless to get going and I have 50Gb of space instead of the 3Gb I get with Dropbox.
Those are the minimum things I really need to put on the computer. Here are
the follow up things I'll need for less active projects or that I will
probably end up wanting:  

  * MS Excel
  * [MS Word Viewer](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3657ce88-7cfa-457a-9aec-f4f827f20cac&displaylang=en)
  * MS Visual Studio 2005
  * MS Visual Studio 2008
  * [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
  * [PHP ](http://php.net/)  

  * [Ruby (1.8)](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)  

  * [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) ([Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/))  

  * [Python](http://www.python.org/)
  * [Gom Media Player](http://www.gomlab.com/eng/)
  * [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) (so MediaMonkey can talk to my iPhone)
  * [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) \- my favorite photo management software. Not because it is amazingly feature rich (I actually liked adobe's better) but because it is free and works pretty well.
  * [IsoRecorder](http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm)
  * [iPhoneBrowser](http://code.google.com/p/iphonebrowser/)
  * [PDF2XL Enterprise Edition](http://www.cogniview.com/pdf2xl-enterprise.php) \- this tool is pretty freaking amazing at converting PDF files to Excel files. It's a little over $100 for their best version and it is worth every penny. On the downside their licensing/activation process is onerous.  

  * [Cisco Systems VPN Client](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps2308/)
  * ...
Undoubtedly I'm forgetting a few programs. When I encounter those I'll try to
come back here and update the list.

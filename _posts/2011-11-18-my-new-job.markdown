For the past 12 years I have worked for a wonderful small company named
Strictly Business Computer Systems. During that time I've had the priviledge
of working alongside some amazingly bright and talented people. I will miss
both the workplace and my coworkers enormously as I move forward towards a new
opportunity at Marshall University. I'll still be developing software using a
variety of languages and tools and I'll still be blogging my solutions to
weird little problems; I'll just be doing it with a little less focus on
ColdFusion and a little more on PHP, .Net, and SharePoint.

Spike has thrown some more FU around today and released another cool plgin for
Eclipse called [File System Plugin](http://www.spike.org.uk/blog/index.cfm?do=
blog.entry&entry=E892E50E-D565-E33F-3845337AB7A2A27D). It looks like a pretty
nice solution to a long standing Eclipse problem. And, to top it off, it will
try to open your file with the CFEclipse editor first before falling back to
the default eclipse editor. Nifty!  

By default Spike says its just for Windows at the moment. However, [Sean
Corfield blogged](http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm?do=blog.entry&entry
=E8CC9ABF-C7CE-D80A-282ABAF468A97339) about this as well and discusses how he
gets it to work with OSX.

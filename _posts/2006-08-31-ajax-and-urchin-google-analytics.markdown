It turns out you can use Urchin to track Ajax usage (who knew?) - here is a
handy page in the Google Analytics Help Center that [tells you how](http://www

This is similar to the way you'd track events (or "pages") on a flash site: ht
tp://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=27243&amp;ctx;=sibl

(http://www.pierinc.com) in that manner.

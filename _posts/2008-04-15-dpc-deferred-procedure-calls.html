First I need to retract my statement that Flock was causing all of the DPC issues I was having.  It wasn't - instead it was a much more subtle problem and I'm still not entirely sure what to do about it.<br /><br />DPC's or Deferred Procedure Calls have been intermittently bringing my laptop to its proverbial knees over the past few weeks.  Initially I had blamed the social browser, Flock.  After I removed it the problem persisted though (this was a pretty intermittent problem) and I have waited until know to admit I was wrong becuase I wanted to know what the heck was going on.<br /><br />This morning the DPC situation arose again.  I was cruising along getting some work done when suddenly my machine became unusable.  ProcessExplorer told me the DPC's were back eating up 60-80 of my CPU and there was nothing I could do to stop it short of a reboot but I really didn't want to reboot.<br /><br />I keep all of my music on an external USB harddrive and I had some background processes going that were converting some songs from one format to another but when I stopped them the DPC issue didn't go away.  I tried to disconnect the USB drive but it wouldn't let me - windows said it was in use.  WTF?  I wasn't using it.<br /><br />One of my office mates was though.  He was copying the install for Open Office off my share. I didn't know that however so I just turned off the drive. Instantly the DPC problem disappeared.  I started the drive back up and the DPC problem didn't resume for a bit but then, suddenly, it was back.  After stopping the drive again and then having my friend ask what was up with my drive I put 2 and 2 together.  His access of the drive was causing the DPC's.<br /><br />My initial thought was that maybe there was something wrong with my external harddrive.  So I copied the OpenOffice file to my internal harddrive, shared it, and then my friend tried to copy it from the new location. DPC Spike!  What a pain!<br /><br />I don't know why copying stuff off of my computer would cause a CPU usage spike on my machine but for the time being I am now off the local net with my share.  If anyone knows what might cause the DPC usage and how I can alleviate it while still helping out my co-workers I would greatly appreciate it!</div>

the problem I am having is definitely related to my external hard drive and copying files from it.<BR/><BR/>Three of us in my office have the same laptop and none of us have a DPC problem normally - regardless what we are doing with them - until the external harddrive is connected and you try to copy a file off of it.<BR/><BR/>I didn't know the cause before because I have a shared directory on the drive that people were copying from.  For the time being I have just disabled the share however, eventually, I'd like to fix the problem.</div>

Probably your video card that's causing the DPC's.  I recently installed a new video card in my machine and would get DPC's that would cause the computer to come to a crawl.  Once the card was removed, the DPC's disappeared.  There is a lot of information on forums regarding the issue, a search of google should turn up lots of relevant results.  I believe it has something to do with the GPU unit on the video card becoming too hot, either that or a driver issue with the card.</div>

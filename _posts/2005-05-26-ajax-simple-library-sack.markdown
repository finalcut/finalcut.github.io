[SACK](http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05/sack-of-ajax/) I saw a link to this
from the AJAX weblog at mxna today and decided to finally take a look at
someone elses ajax library. This one fits right in with my style. It is very
simple and super easy to use. Unlike SAJAX (how they call it simple I dunno)
it doesn't require any wierd backend stuff. Its just a clean and easy to use
interface to the xmlHttpRequest object. Its not perfect - but it works nicely
and he is fixing some things and cleaning it up some for a new version. If you
haven't yet you should [check it out](http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05
/sack-of-ajax/).

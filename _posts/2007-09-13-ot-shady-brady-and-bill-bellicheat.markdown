Wow, my friend Ryan is on a tear right now and is cranking out new songs. This
new one is really funny and makes fun of [Bill Bellichek and his cheating
ways](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EU1O-hGxgg). He explores the success the
Patriots have had and wonders how much has been done via sneaky camera work.

Here is the link to the [actual post with the
video](http://www.bandwagonbar.com/2007/10/ode-to-buffalo-bills.html)  

sorry about that

Bill

He has a bunch of songs - and some newer ones about the Patriots - and he
wrote one about the Bills that you can see over at

Love it! Although I think maybe their Sony wasn't working before they were
shut out by the Bills 31-0 a few years ago... (it was working later that
season when they returned the favor by the same score)

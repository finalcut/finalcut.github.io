In 1999, for my Senior Project at University, I built a java shared
workspace/chat/whiteboard/videochat type thing. It isn't the greatest
collection of code ever but some of it isn't too bad. If nothing else I
learned a lot working on it.  
  
The project is now indexed in [Koders](http://www.koders.com/info.aspx?c=Proje
ctInfo&pid=NU4RZUPHL7LTN7QVZ5QF7YRE7A) (and has been on
[sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharedspace/) for a long time)
so if you are looking for some ideas or want to much around with the code you
can now check it out in detail.

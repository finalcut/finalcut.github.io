<div class='post'>
So, for some crazy reason my blog was flagged by Blogger as a "spam blog".  I am not sure if that is because people were flagging it maliciously or what but after about a week of waiting (from the time I asked blogger to review) I received an email today telling me my blog is, in fact, NOT a spam blog.  Hooray!<br /><br />You may be wondering how I knew my blog was identified by blogger as a spam blog.  Well, prior to today for about the past six months-year I have had to fill out a captcha just to post to my own blog.  I had thought this captcha was just a side-effect to me demanding captcha's on all comments people leave on the blog because it seemed to appear pretty closely to when I turned on that feature.  However, there was a little text link beside the captcha that said "why am I seeing this" which I have always ignored.  Curiosity piqued the other day though and I clicked it and found out I was considered a spam blog.  Fortunately it was an easy, albeit slow, process for getting my blog's name cleared.</div>

The exact same thing happened to me on <A HREF="agileui.blogspot.com" REL="nofollow">my blog</A>. And just last week, I noticed that little link. I am pretty sure it wasn't there 'til recently, but I am so glad that I no longer need to deal with that.</div>

Perhaps because I hardly know anyone I don't really get what use there is to "twitter" or any of the other "status" services out there.  However, I have an account - my username is <a href="http://twitter.com/finalcut">finalcut</a>.  I am hopeful someone can really explain the benefit of the service to me.</div>

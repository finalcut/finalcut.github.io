Thanks to Squize at [Tales From the Code
Front](http://www.stimunationgames.de/blog/blog_comment.asp?blog_id=210) I was
pointed to a tip on [how to block popups that are snuck into firefox via
flash](http://www.petebevin.com/archives/2005/03/10/firefox_popups.html).  

Pretty handy. If you need to let a specific site use this technique (for
security purposes) Just add that site to your whitelist.  

To edit your whitelist I think you just need to:  



  1. Goto Tools | Options


  2. Choose Web Features


  3. Click on the button "Allowed Sites" by block popups


  4. Enter the site url


  5. Click Allow

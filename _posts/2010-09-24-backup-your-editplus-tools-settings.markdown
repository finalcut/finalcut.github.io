If you use EditPlus, and you're like me, you also have a bunch of tools
defined and configured for use within the editor.  Tools are super useful but
they are also a bit of a pain in the ass to configure.  Fortunately, thanks to
my co-worker Mike today, I was able to find the file that holds all of the
tools settings so now I can back it up and move port it to different computers
whenever I set them up in the future.  
  
I'm on Windows XP so your path maybe different.  For me all tool configuration
information is in the file c:\documents and settings\\{username}\Application
Data\EditPlus 3\tool_u.ini  
  
I'm pretty stoked to have finally found this as I know I've wasted a bunch of
time in the past duplicating the effort of setting up my tools.  Thanks Mike.

Thanks very much for this post, just what I needed to migrate 7 years of FTP
settings, hotkeys, etc to Editplus on a new machine. Thanks!

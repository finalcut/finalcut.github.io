Knowing the value of a database plan I pretty much always use the
<cfqueryparam> tag inside queries with variable parameters. However,
recently I encountered a problem with the <cfqueryparam> tag and
ColdFusion 5. You may be wondering why I'm still using CF5 and the answer is -
its what that specific customer is using. So, now that I have justified my use
of CF 5, and explained why I can't use MX on this project, I'll explain the
problem with some code.


```cfc
  <cfset someListOfIds = "1,2,3,4,5,,7,10,21">

  <cfquery name="someQuery" datasource="somedsn">
  SELECT * FROM someTable where id IN <cfqueryparam
  cfsqltype="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="#someListOfIds#" list="true" />
  </cfquery>

```


On CFMX this runs without a problem. But, on CF5 it does not. Instead it
crashes saying that I can't pass in a "" value as an integer in my list. (I
would put some official error text here but I don't have it handy sorry.)

The problem arises with the list. You will notice that between the 5 and 7 of
the list is an empty element. Now, CF ALWAYS treats that list as a 8 element
list, ignoring the empty elements, right? Well, not in CF 5 with the
<cfqueryparam> tag. Instead it treats it as a 9 element list and tries
to pass in the empty string value. Because of that, and because the
application using this might have empty element lists being passed around I
now have to introduce a new function to strip out empty elements.


```cfc
  function listDropEmpty(list){
  var newList = "";
  var i = 1;
  var tArray = ListToArray(list);
  for(i=1; i LTE arrayLen(tArray); i=i+1){
  newList = listAppend(newList,tArray[i]);
  }
  return newList;
  }

```


With this simple function I am able to drop the empty elements. Another option
I could use instead is ListSort as it returns a sorted list and will thus drop
the empty element. I suppose it is just a matter of preference and the
performance. I don't know how one performs against the other. It seems like
ListSort might take longer since it is actually doing quite a bit more than my
listDropEmpty option but I haven't tested this.

So beware lists and <cfqueryparam> in CF 5!

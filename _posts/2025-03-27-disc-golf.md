I've always used this site to talk about _work_ stuff but I think I'm going to have a bit more fun with it.  So in that vein I'm going to kick it off with some disc golf.

Last year I played in 19 tournaments!  That was, easily, a personal record.  Eighteen of them were amatuer and one professional.  I won 5 of the amatuer events and the one professional.  Overall, it was a good year.  This year I don't think I'll play in as many - but I have played in four so far and have registered for five more already. If you are really curious you can follow along with my schedule on [disc golf scene](https://www.discgolfscene.com/profile/20634).  For official "sanctioned" events you can also check out my [PDGA profile](https://www.pdga.com/player/96685).

So far this year I've played "okay" but haven't really done anything outstanding.  In my two pro events I have come in last place.  In this past event I was only 2 strokes behind the winner but I was still in last (of 3 players).  Pretty disappointing.  In my one Advanced event (playing against mostly younger, better, players) I did pretty well and finished in 5 out of 15.

In addition to the events I am scheduled for this year already I have a bunch on my "watchlist" - 13 in fact!  Wow.  Also one I know I will be at which isn't "watchable" yet.  I may actually surpass last years record.  I have a problem.

Im most excited about the [Tennessee State Championship](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/86667).  It will be the biggest event I've played in and I'm playing in the MP50 (mixed-gender, pro 50 years and older).  It should be a big challenge and a lot of fun.

I started the season with a rating of 919.  So far it has fallen, already, to a 915.  I have 11 career wins in 82 events.  Historically, I've gunned for at least 1 win per 10 events.  I'm ahead of that would like to stay there.  Last year was so successful for me it will be hard to surpass.  However, I still have some goals for this year that I think are achievable.

<div class="notice--info"><h4>Goals</h4>
<ul>
<li>[&nbsp;&nbsp;] End of Year Rating &gt; 920</li>
<li>[x] At least one tournament victory - mp40 win at [Thorn Spring Fling](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/88892#MP40)</li>
<li>[x] At least one "cash" position in a pro event</li>
</ul>
</div>

As I compete I'll keep this post update with my results and track my season goals.  I may have some individual posts based on certain events.  Stay tuned!

| 22 MAR | Spring Break at Goliath | MP50     | Y   | 3           | 3     | 2                | good second round            |
| 05 APR | Chucktown Throwdown     | MA1      | N   | 10          | 9     | 13               | second round was decent but wow, I got my ass whipped!  First round I was only 4 behind the leader.. my rating was only 886 vs 947.  lots of points per stroke!|
| 12 APR | Thorn Spring Fling 6    | MP40     | Y   | 2           | 1     | -                 | I won.  I played okay but my sole competitor was having rough day with grip issues. It was cool playing with the world champs dad though.  Nice guy.  First time I also played with MPO guys.  They can throw FAR and FAST wow. |
| 26 APR | Shaffers Auto Sales     | MP40     | Y   | 3           | 2     | I tried to come in third but played really smart golf on the last hole.  The guy who won was just _better_. |
| 24 MAY | Don Kleppe Memorial     | MP40     | Y   | 7           | 2     | I played really well - a couple stumbles in round 2.  But with an event rating of apx 943 I have no shame in coming in second |
| 30 MAY | Tennessee States        | MP50     | Y   | 12          | 7     | Great first round.. mediocre second, shit third.  I am really disappointed in myself. I legit should have finished in the top 5.  Such a collapse |
| 06 JUN | KVR                     | MA40     | N   | 12          | 8     | Weird event.  Good first round except one hole.  WORST ROUND OF MY LIFE Second round rated 720!?  Great final round at 950.  Went from 1st, to last, to 4th.  Glad that 720 doesn't count against my overall rating! |

I just updated the sites feed to be published by feedburner instead of the
normal blogspot feed. This shouldn't have any impact on my few (if any)
subscribers but I thought I should give a heads up.  
  
I'm also including, at least as a temporary trial, google adsense in the new
feed. If it seems like a pain in the ass or is too distracting, or if my few
(if any) readers complain about it then I'll remove it.  
  
Sorry for this totally meta post.

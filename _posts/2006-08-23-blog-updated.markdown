I just moved over to the new "blogger beta" and in so doing I also changed the
sites template.  

Nothing too exciting but overall I'm glad to be on the "cutting edge" here in
blogger.com world. So far I like the changes on the back-end; maybe I'll be
inspired to post more frequently now?

the site used to look a bit different (green and white) and the back end stuff
(what I use to post to the blog) has been updated to be a bit faster.  

overall there isn't a whole lot different in this iteration of blogger (or
this blog).  

This post was mainly designed to let the few regular readers I have know they
were still at the right place even though the pages look drastically different
(green and fixed width to blue and fluid).

I only see the widgets and some nicer colors.. unless I'm missing something

I took the c# generic singleton provider example found at [The Code
Project](http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/genericsingleton.asp) and converted
it to VB.net syntax using the [power of generics](http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/
a/dotnet/2004/05/25/whidbey_vbnet_pt2.html). Here it is:


```vbnet
Public Class SingletonProvider(Of itemtype As {New})
Public Sub New()
End Sub


Public Shared ReadOnly Property Instance() As itemtype

Get
Return SingletonCreator.instance
End Get

End Property
Class SingletonCreator
Shared Sub New()
End Sub

Public Shared ReadOnly instance As itemtype = New itemtype()
End Class
End Class

```


Now, whenever you want to create a singleton object you call this provider.
For example, lets say you want a singleton instance of your DAO Factory which
you conveniently called daoFactory you create it like so:


```vbnet
Dim myDaoFactory as DaoFactory = Singleton(Of DaoFactory).Instance

```


The prior implementation of the Singleton provider has one constraint on it;
that is the objects you want to create as singletons have to have a public New
method that takes in zero parameters.

A cool thing about this is now the code for managing the singleton creation is
removed from all your objects and your objects can focus on what they actually
do instead of how to persist themselves in memory.

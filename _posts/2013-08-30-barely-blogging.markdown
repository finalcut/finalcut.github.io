So far my move to Octopress has resulted in one thing - I blog less than ever.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or not.  The main problem I've been having is that I setup the blog using my personal laptop at home.  But, oftentimes, I want to blog while I'm at work about some little thing I found interesting while working.  My home computer is a Mac and my work computer is a Windows PC.  I was having some problems getting the whole Jekyll stack to work on my PC.  However, yesterday I managed to get Octopress installed at work and I found some instructions for setting up Octopress so that I can blog from two machines.

The only potential problem, at the moment, is that my Gemfile.lock is different in the two places so I have to be careful to not let Octopress push my gemfile.lock changes to github.

For those interested here are the [instructions for getting Octopress setup on two machines](http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/).

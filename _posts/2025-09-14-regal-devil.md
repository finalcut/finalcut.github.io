description: photos of a large Hickory Horned Devil caterpillar

This amazing caterpillar was crawling across a creek bed yesterday.  It is a Hickory Horned Devil - and it transforms into a Regal Moth aka the Royal Walnut Moth.  

This caterpillar was at least 4-5" long.  Probably the biggest caterpillar I've ever seen!

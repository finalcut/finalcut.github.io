<div class='post'>
For the past 12 years I have worked for a wonderful small company named Strictly Business Computer Systems.  During that time I've had the priviledge of working alongside some amazingly bright and talented people.  I will miss both the workplace and my coworkers enormously as I move forward towards a new opportunity at Marshall University.  I'll still be developing software using a variety of languages and tools and I'll still be blogging my solutions to weird little problems; I'll just be doing it with a little less focus on ColdFusion and a little more on PHP, .Net, and SharePoint.</div>

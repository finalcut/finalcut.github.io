Some of the people who find my blog ask about Ryan and his songs. He tried to
stop singing and writing songs about six months ago but the lure of sports
songs was too strong for him and he is back. He has put all of his videos back
up on youtube and has even put up a couple new ones already. So if you have
been wanting to hear ryan's songs go over to his website at
[RyanParkerSongs.com](http://ryanparkersongs.com) and give them a listen.  
  
Here is his newest video, Blame it on a Bengal, which makes fun of all the
criminal trouble the Cincinnati Bengals have had

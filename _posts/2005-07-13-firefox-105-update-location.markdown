Since it isn't obvious, as of today, where the 1.05 update of FF is (win32
only) I figured I would post an FTP link here:  

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0.5/update/win32/en-
US/  

Just in case you don't want to download the install (which may or may not
require uninstalling of 1.04, I dunno).

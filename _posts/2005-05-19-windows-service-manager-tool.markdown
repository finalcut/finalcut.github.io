If you have to start/stop services at all during a typically development day
then [this free
tool](http://www.shlomygantz.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=C7D6FEE1
-40CA-7F8D-8E76EF91F5737896) will probably be a great help to you.  
  
It lets you create simple profiles that start or stop various services. So if
your running CF 6 and CF 7 on the same box you can jump between the two
profiles very easilly. Check it out!  
  
In the future they are talking about letting you potentially queue the order
of the start/stop requests which would be really handy!

Hey!  
  
I found a similar service manager:  
http://winservicemanager.codeplex.com/  
  
It is free and you can request custom functions that the developer implements
for you.

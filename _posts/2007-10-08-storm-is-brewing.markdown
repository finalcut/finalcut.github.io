[According to Bruce Schneier](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentar
y/securitymatters/2007/10/securitymatters_1004) there is a pretty wicked and
troublesome worm/trojan/virus on the lose (and has been for the past year)
called "Storm"  
  
Normally I don't pay much attention to these kind of things but this
particular beast seems especially dangerous. As Bruce is a recognized security
expert I figure he probably isn't just crying wolf here.  
  

> Worms like Storm are written by hackers looking for profit, and they're
different. These worms spread more subtly, without making noise. Symptoms
don't appear immediately, and an infected computer can sit dormant for a long
time. If it were a disease, it would be more like syphilis, whose symptoms may
be mild or disappear altogether, but which will eventually come back years
later and eat your brain.

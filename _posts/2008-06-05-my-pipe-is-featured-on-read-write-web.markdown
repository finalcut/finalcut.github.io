Kind of cool but not too big of a deal - I just visited Read Write Web and I
saw an article about their favorite Yahoo Pipes and my pipe, [Netflix to
Amazon](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=EpbPqzO82xGhewo3IBeTaQ) is
present. I don't really go out of my way to advertise anything, particularly
not something this trivial - but it is still cool to see my work featured
somewhere.  
  
So thanks RWW (and Yahoo).  
  
Currently there is one small problem - my netflix user id is temporarily
disabled becuase I am trying to cut back on expenses. So I need a new user id
to be added as the default so that the demo returns something. If you want it
to be your user id just leave a comment and the first one I get will be the
one I use. Or you can email me at wmrspam@gmail.com with the subject line of
Netflix to Amazon and include your user id in the email body. Thanks

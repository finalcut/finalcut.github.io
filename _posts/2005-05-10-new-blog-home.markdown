With the release of mxna 2.0 I am finally getting away from the
bill.coldfusionjournal.com site address and moving here.  

While both options are free I'm moving for a couple reasons:  

  1. Better Editor
  2. A bit more control
  3. I can change the way it looks
  4. No advertising all over my blog.
  5. Better feeds (includes a summary in my atom feed).  

So, if you used to visit me at http://bill.coldfusionjournal.com you will want
to update your bookmarks to point here, <strikeout>http://cf-bill.blogspot.com</strieout>
http://code.rawlinson.us instead.  

Thanks!

The blog looks much cleaner. Plus, I bet you get higher search rankings on
Google. ;)

Yesterday Dave Ross and Sean Corfield both stopped by this blog and clarified a couple points in my last post.  So I wanted to put those comments here so that anyone following along wouldn't miss them.<br /><br />Dave said that by turning off CF debugging (particularly measuring of execution time) that MG would be faster.  He was right.  However, without the debugging trace on I can't give you a clear measurement of the difference.  Using just MG debugging each execution that was taking 1.5 seconds with CF debugging was taking 700ms without it.  I imagine it is even faster without the MG debugging.<br /><br />Sean answered my question on the best practice for forwarding in MG by saying that whenever possible I should use the XML result notation instead of the event.forward method.  That is what I suspected but it is nice to have confirmation.<br /><br />He also mentioned the fact that you can do event chaining without forwarding at all.  While I figured you could (using the Broadcast xml directive in ModelGlue.xml) I hadn't/haven't tested that yet.  I just want to make sure anyone else reading this is aware of the capability as well.<br /><br />Next up, adding a db backend to my lame Todo application.</div>

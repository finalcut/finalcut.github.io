This is my final post, I hope, on the topic of Firebug and Gmail
compatibility. A recent reader of my blog has posted a [xpi hack that will get
Firebug to not interact with Gmail ](http://www.paulchaplin.com/blog/firebug-
and-gmail-friends-at-last/)at all so you can keep a Gmail tab open and keep
Firebug active.

If you decide to edit the xpi yourself I have summarized the code change here:


```js
FireBug.isWindowInspectable = function(win)
{
var isOK = false;

if(win.location.href != "about:blank" &&amp;
win.location.href.indexOf('mail.google.com') == -1){
isOK = true;
}


return isOK;

}

```


This change goes in the following file:

<your documents and settings path>\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<your profile>\extensions\firebug@software
.joehewitt.com\chrome\firebug.jar\content\firebug\firebug.js

After you make the change just restart your browser to have it take effect.
Before making any changes though I encourage you to [read his blog
post](http://www.paulchaplin.com/blog/firebug-and-gmail-friends-at-last/). It
provides much more complete and step -by- step instructions or an alternative
already edited XPI file you can install.

Thanks Paul

Bill

thank you for digging in and finding the hack.

I should have done the same but the thought never even occured to me. I'm
getting lazy I guess :O)

Ah, update: just after bumping that thread, I saw Joe's [recent blog post
about FireBug](http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/next_firebug.php) \- someone had
already posted a comment requesting domain filtering, so I echoed it. Here's
hoping!

Glad I could help, and thanks for posting about it. :)

I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that Joe will add a GUI blacklist (and
possibly whitelist) option soon, since someone else [requested
it](http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14) a
while back on his forum (and I just bumped it).

If that doesn't happen, I'll see about doing it myself, to make the current
solution more generalised - it can't be just us and just Gmail experiencing
problems.

Cheers Bill.

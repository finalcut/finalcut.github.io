Here is a pretty well written and concise explanation of the three Higher
Level Functions - [Filter, Map, and
Reduce](http://diditwith.net/PermaLink,guid,a1a76478-03d2-428f-
9db6-9cf4e300ea0f.aspx) \- including some nice generic C# implementations of
the same.  


I'd explain the article for you here but the author does such a nice job of
taking the concept and making it easy to understand I figure I would just
muddy the waters. So go and read it!

I was working on a simple custom control today that displays thumbnails. The
thumbnail ordering can be changed by dragging/dropping and you can double
click a thumbnail to have a full version of the image pop up in a new dialog.
Pretty simple - or is it?

It turns out that the DragDrop functionality is turned on for an object during
the MouseDown event. However, when you double click the MouseDown event is
also fired and thus the app thinks you are dragging after the first click and
the DoubleClick event won't get fired. What's a coder to do?

I looked all over for an idea and the best anyone could suggest was combining
MouseDown (set a flag) with MouseMove (start DragDrop if flag is set) to start
the DragDrop. This doesn't work too well though if you do a mouseup outside
the app (and then drag the mouse back in in the up or down state).

It turns out though that there is a easy and pretty clean solution. The
MouseDown event passes along a collection of MouseEventArgs. One of those
values is "Clicks" that tells you how many times the mouse was clicked. The
event gets called once for a click and again for a double click. So when you
double click it calls MouseDown twice. The first time it "enter drag mode" but
as soon as you raise the button to click the second time it exits drag mode.
The second mousedown has a "Clicks" value of 2 and you can avoid going into
drag mode and thus the DoubleClick will be fired.


```c#
void pictureBox_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left && e.Clicks ==1)
{
PictureBox pb = (PictureBox)sender;
DoDragDrop((ImageData)pb.Tag, DragDropEffects.Copy);
}
}


```


In the prior example I only want to enter Drag mode if the left button is
clicked AND it was only clicked one time. I couldn't find this information
anywhere else so hopefully this post will help someone.

Again - thanks. One comment. If for any reason it doesn't work haev a look to
ensure that the clickable item is set as AllowDrop. I needed to do this
otherwise a double click would treat the item as being dropped onto itself and
funny things happened if it wasn't itself set as AllowDrop.

To all the thanks - You're welcome. Glad to help!

Works great. Just had this problem today. ty

Thanks for the help with this. Unfortunately I still couldn't get it to work
in my TreeView. In fact, it even stopped triple-clicking from invoking the
ItemDoubleClick event, which had worked in the past. Maybe I have a strange
combination of other things also interfering like AfterSelect events and so
on.

For anyone having similar problems to me, though, I did find [another
workaround](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-
US/winforms/thread/0b756636-0acb-4972-9fb8-00627cb9f764/) where someone has
suggested making the DoDragDrop() call from the .ItemDrag() event instead of
from the MouseDown() event. Perhaps this just ensures the user is actually
trying to drag it beforehand, or something like that.

It seems to work perfectly for me, at least.

Looked Everywhere for this. Worked like a charm! Thanks!

1) Thanks for the post!

2) Anonimous - Mouse DoubleClick fires 2 events - one with Clicks==1 and one
with Cliks==2.
if you put a break point in MouseDown event, then VS2008 will jump on the
first click and second will never happen.
Try to set a breakpoint with Condition "e.Clicks == 2".

Bill

I have no idea. I still use VS 2005 and have not had a chance to try out any
code in VS 2008.

It seems unlikely that the drag and drop and double click behavior would
change so much but it is possible.

Anonymous

This doesn't work for me. I'm using Visual Studio 2008, and every time I
double-click, the MouseDown event always fires with a Clicks == 1.

Could it be that this behavior has changed with VS2008?

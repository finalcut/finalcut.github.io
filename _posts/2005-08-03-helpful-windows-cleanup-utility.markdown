Based on a link over at "[injun's blog](http://576871.blogspot.com/)" (as seen
on mxna) I decided to download CCcleaner and give it a whirl. When all was
said and done it found about 770MB of temp files it could safely delete from
my system. Plus it found a bunch of no longer valid registry settings. To top
it off it found all of this and cleaned up the mess in under five minutes.  

I have tried using the windows disk cleaner utility before but, let's be
honest, it sucks. It brings my whole system to a halt and takes forever to get
anything done; and that's just during the analyisis phase - you can forget
about using your computer when it is actually cleaning. CCcleaner doesn't have
that problem. I continued to work while CCcleaner did it's job. I highly
recommend (for windows users only).  

You can [download it at cccleaner.com](http://www.ccleaner.com/)

I've found about 2.3 GB of temp files... and cleaning it in less than 1 min.

Well I'm making pretty good progress with my Model-Glue experient.  Thanks to Dave Ross and his "turn the debugging" off double reminder the performance is also pretty darn fast.<br /><br />Where am I? Well, so far I have the abilitiy to create todo's that are stored in a single 'mgTodo' table in my SQL Server database.  I have abstracted that away into a DAO so I could quickly change the backend without a problem and that should work pretty well.<br /><br />I am using a variant of <a href="http://www.web-relevant.com/blogs/cfobjective/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=7B760E34-BDB9-5320-E88A375CA379AB9F">Jared Rypka-Haur's facade component</a> (i modified it quite a bit) but it was an excellent basis for my needs to store the current user object in the session scope.  That's right, I have also added some bare bones security to it.<br /><br />Currently the security is incredibly bare bones using a ConfigBean to identify the only pages in the app that don't require security and a cached security component to check if the user has access to the requested page.  I don't actually have any kind of real login/authentication setup but it is all stubbed out so I can pretend to login (just nothing gets check in the DB) and my user auto has access to everything once I'm pseudo-logged in.<br /><br />All of this worked out pretty well with MG and I was able to abstract pretty much everything I needed to.  However, I did run into a small problem when I introduced multiple controllers.  Basically, all of my controllers need access to my factory object.  However, I don't want to create the factory in each controller and basically have redundant code in each.  So, basically, I'm not sure where that should happen.<br /><br />My solution, was to create a "controller" object that is pretty generic for my needs that extends "ModelGlue.Core.Controller" then each of my controllers extends this generic controller (I know, i'm starting to get a inheiritance tree so I'm not thrilled, but we will see how this works out).<br /><br /><h3>What I was Doing</h3><br />In my basic Controller's init method I had it create an instance of the factory object and store it in it's local variables.instance structure as variables.instance.factory.  The main problem I see with this solution is that I get one factory per Controller created still (but the controller is cached by MG in the application scope so at least it isn't recreated all the time).<br /><br />As my app grows and I think of other objects that need to be in the singleton (or as my factory creates objects which I typically just store in it's private scope) I will have repetitive "singletons" which pretty much destroys the whole idea of a singleton.  What's a guy to do?<br /><br /><h3>My Solution</h3><br />Well I think "What a guy should do" is use the built in Model-Glue "cache" methods, ExistsInCache, AddToCache, and GetFromCache (plus RemoveFromCache).  I'm still going to keep my base "controller" object so I know my various controllers have access to my factory and session, but since the main controller checks against the existance of either singleton in cache ahead of time I should maintain the singularity of each.<br /><br /><h3>One Problem</h3><br />There is still one problem though - the function ModelGlue.Core.Controller.RemoveFromCache says it returns a boolean value.  It inturn calls ModelGlue.Util.TimeCache.RemoveValue which doesn't remove anything (void).  This contradiction raises an error saying that the first method (RemoveFromCache) isn't returning a boolean.  So, I updated my copy to return void and changed the line (56) cfreturn variables.ModelGlue.ModelGlueCache.removeValue(arguments.name) to cfset variables.ModelGlue.ModelGlueCache.removeValue(arguments.name)</div>

Doesn't appear a bug report was filed for this until today. This is fixed in the bleeding edge version.<BR/><BR/>http://trac.model-glue.com/model-glue/ticket/307</div>

You may want to ask Joe Reinhart about how to change the behavior of MG.  You can find him at http://www.model-glue.com or sign up for the model-glue mailing list and ask your question there because, frankly, I don't know the answer to your question.</div>

Hi <BR/><BR/>In modelglue 1 if we call a function in controller which actually doesnt exist from the ModelGlue.xml message listener part<BR/>it will cause an error.<BR/><BR/>But in modelglue 2 this doenst seem to happen. Is there any way <BR/>to get it back like it was in modelglue 1</div>

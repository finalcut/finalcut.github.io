<p>My blog here was looking like complete shit. The theme had broken and I am not really sure how to fix it so I’m starting over.  Most of my old posts may never come back but we’ll see.  For the most part I’m not sure they had that much value at this point in time.</p>

<p>I’ll dig through the archive and see what I might want to restore.  Otherwise, I hope this fresh start will get me blogging again.</p>

<p>If you are looking for my social presense you can find me in a couple places:</p>
